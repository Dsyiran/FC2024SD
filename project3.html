	<h2> Week 3 Piece - Fried Egg. </h2>

    <h4>In this week's exploration process, I used the same idea as in previous weeks. First, I divided the content to be drawn into different modules and then programmed the basic framework of each module. Once I had the basic pattern content, I started adding various mouse-related variables to their coordinates. To make each module work together, I added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided the different parameters to make them balance. After programming the graphics that change with the mouse, I added the Settings that the colors change with the mouse and the patterns change randomly within the range. And that gives you an omelet that changes color and loses yolk as it changes size.</h4>
