    <h2>Week 11 Piece - Gun Shooting Game.</h2>

    <h4>
      Concept Applied: In this two-week project, we are trying to designa a game base on p5.js program. As I am a deep first person shooter game player both in 2D and 3D, so I want to create a game base on the design concept of 2D shooter games.
    </h4>

    <h4>
      Process: In the process of design, I made the game in a garden-like stage that I drew. A cowboy will be the character controlled by player. By using keys of "W","A","S","D", the cowboy will be able to move around in the range of 600*600px frame and shoot towards his enemies by "left click" the mouse when it is pointing to the target directions.
