    <h2>Week 10 Piece - Animate Data Portrait.</h2>

    <h4>Concept Applied: In this work, I collected the whole weeks' data of everyday weather and temperature, and I did record around 4 to 5 times a day.</h4>

    <h4>Monday
        4pm Sunny; 5:24 cloudy 14 degree
        Tuesday
        8:24 Windy & Cloudy 12 degree; 12:40 windy & cloudy 16 degree; 2:31 windy 16 degree; 4:25 rainy 14 degree; 5:35 rainy 12 degree
        Wednesday 
        12:28 cloudy & little rainy 14 degree; 4:07 cloudy 16 degree; 6:09 cloudy 15 degree;6:27 cloudy 13 degree; 7:49 cloudy 12 degree; 10:38 cloudy 11 degree
        Thursday

    <h4>Process: In the process of writing this program, I chose the way of managing my data into different representations. I use four different colors to represent the weather of the day, different length of the bubble to represent the recording time of the day, and different length of height to represent the temperature of the time. Then I put them into random display coding to create an animate result.</h4>

    <h4>Reflection: I think it is hard, which is also the aim of this project, to avoid the lost of original data concept when doing animated version of it on canvas. I think drawing the inforgraphic version in real life will be much easier to show the collected data, but the coding version could absolutely give an additional point of view.</h4>
