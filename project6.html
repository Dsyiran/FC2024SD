    <h2>Week 9 Piece - Optical Illusion Painting.</h2>

    <h4>Concept Applied: In this work, I used the feature that background and pattern will merge with each other when the color is the same. When the mouse is pressed, the background color will randomly change between three different solid colors, which will also change the pattern displayed on the canvas. The long press of the mouse will act like a thick brush window, creating more possible results.</h4>
    <h4>Reflection: In the process of writing this program, I found that adding color variables on top of different patterns can create more possibilities. And as colors themselves, when they have a certain volume, they also have the ability to create pattern-like paths. But I also realized that with each additional variable, the complexity of the results would increase exponentially, so I chose only three solid colors for experimental demonstration.</h4>
