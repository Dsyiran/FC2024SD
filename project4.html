    <h2>Week 7 Piece - Hunger Clock.</h2>

    <h4>In this week's programming, I made a hunger clock.  As the program begins to run, the bar hand on the clock gradually changes from white to red.  The bar hand itself moves around the 60-scale dial in the same motion as the second hand.  At the same time, in the upper left corner, there is also solution of how to make the hunger value zero.  At the bottom of the page is a button that says "Get some food" to clear the hunger value.  At the same time, I also added another variable, day and night.  In order to indicate the day and night alternations faster, I set up the pointer to rotate once and represent a day and night alternations, and different backgrounds and words in different time periods would reflect this change.</h4>
    <h4>Of the three themes that our group conceived at the beginning, we had three themes about the clock of nocturnal time, the Hunger clock, and the tidal force clock. Since the topic I want is about hunger clock, I am more interested in this topic, so I chose this topic as my programming direction.</h4>
    <h4>In this programming process, I further learned how to use conditional coding language, build buttons and color change feedback to promote interaction with the audience.</h4>
